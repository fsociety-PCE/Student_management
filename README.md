# College Student Registration Backend

This is the backend server for the College Student Registration project. It provides RESTful APIs for managing student registration data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Additionally, you'll need to have MongoDB installed and running on your system. You can download and install MongoDB from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd college-student-registration-backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

This project uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
```

Replace `<your_mongodb_uri>` with the URI of your MongoDB database.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server when changes are detected.
